              I moved from Brazil and, for a while, I relaxed.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              The habits I carried—situational awareness, home-defence practice, vehicle risk training, range time, first-aid—faded into the background.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Then the quiet shifted.

              Break-and-enters rose. A gunpoint carjacking happened a few streets from my home in Kitchener. The question became real: If someone comes in, what do we actually do?

              Most services sell cameras, apps, and contracts. Meanwhile, minutes pass inside your kitchen and hallway. In those minutes you need clarity: where to move, what to say (and not say), which changes buy time.

              I start at the curb, read approach lines and light, test first contact. I map weak points, specify fixes, and see the work through—quietly and cleanly. And I teach plain-language steps your family can remember under stress.

              No fear theatre. No hard sell.
